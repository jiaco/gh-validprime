0)	Bug, if the postcheck() popup is so big, you cannot see buttons
	closing the dialog with the X puts the app into postcheck state
	which is a dead end

	Need a checkbox to ask use if assays are validated
		if yes, then give up on ZERO confidence for gDNA indexes < N
		as we dont care, just get data

	checkbox in Check and if not-checked and not at least 3 gDNA then warn
	and send back to Check
DONE

1) get params to be keyed : load/inputfile load/inputformat
 and then use that _myApp->paramNames( "load" );
DONE

2) get advanced run params in place and in GUI

3) stop putting _#_ in front of samples and put (rlabel-Row%1) only if duplicate
WAIT this is messed up via the Conc Sorter

4) fix all crashes when loading from wrong format and figure out what
 kind of code is just seqfaulting

5) add colors and heat map preferences

6) wait to push until this is all implemented

BUG IS IN HEATMAP CODE...
