<h1>ValidPrime Help</h1>
<p>ValidPrime consists of 4 steps that must be followed in order:</p>
<p>The order is shown in the top toolbar, Load -> Check -> Run -> Save Files</p>
<p>Elements of the interface that are not a part of the current step will be
inactive to aid you in following the steps. You can use the Reload button to return to the load step,
and the Recheck button to return to the configuration step.


<h2>Loading Input</h2>
<p>Input files must be in Stepone or Fluidigm format. Spreadsheet format, typically output from excel-type programs, is also supported. Spreadsheet files should have the Assay names as a header and the Sample names in the first column.<p>
<p>If you try to load a file in a format different from the format specified in the Input Format field, the program may crash or you will end up with garbage in the grid, so be sure to check your input in the grid before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Checking Input/Parameters</h2>
<p>The Validate Assays checkbox should only be checked if you have a gDNA dilution series with at least 3, preferably 4 samples.</p>
<p>The LOD (Limit of Detection) is used to flag input values above a threshold. This parameter can seriously effect the number of A+ GOIs; ridiculous values should be avoided.</p>
<p>In order to run ValidPrime, certian row and column labels must be selected to dictate where the 
gDNA Sample columns are and where the ValidPrime Assay is in the input. Input must be loaded 
prior to the Check step so that the row and column labels are available within the program.</p>
<p>If the gDNA concentrations are not the sole numeric entities with the selected row labels,
you can enter them manually using the Check/Set [gDNA] button.</p>
<p>If there are Rows (Samples) or Columns (Assays) you want ValidPrime to ingore, set them as well.</p>
<p>When using a gDNA dilution series, if an Assay has at least Min-Count for SD values, the standard deviation will be calculated and checked against High All-SD Cutoff to mark High-Confidence Assays. If there are enough samples to perform a leave-on-out (LOO) analysis, that will also be taken into consideration.<p>
<p>If Check was successful, the Run button will become enabled and you can run ValidPrime.</p>

<h2>Run ValidPrime</h2>
<p>ValidPrime assigns Grades based on the %-DNA in each cell of the input grid. The defaults are 3% or less for an A, 25% or less for a B, and 60% or less for a C. Any cell in which the %-DNA is greater than or equal to the Grade C max will be flagged as HIGHDNA.</p>

<h2>Viewing and Saving Results</h2>
<p>Use the Generate Output Names button to create a series of output file names based on the input file. 
Select any output files you want to create via the individual checkboxes. Upon clicking 'Save' each selected output file will be created.</p>
<p>In order to merely view the results within ValidPrime, you can use the View menu to select the results 
to view in a simple grid.The Toggle Grid button can be used to show different types of values in the main application grid as well.</p>
<p>The ValidPrime scores can also be viewed in a HeatMap with custom coloring-schemes.</p>
