<h1>ValidPrime Help</h1>
<p>ValidPrime consists of 4 steps that must be followed in order:</p>
<p>The order is shown in the top toolbar, Load -> Check -> Run -> Save Files</p>
<p>Elements of the interface that are not a part of the current step will be
inactive to aid you in following the steps. You can use the Reload button to return to the load step,
and the Recheck button to return to the configuration step.
<p>Beware, when using ValidPrime for the first time or on a new file, you will <b>have to run Check twice</b>. This is because the selection of Rows and Columns to use a gDNA Samples and ValidPrime Assays cannot be chosen before check has been run at least once. Once the proper labels have been selected, Check needs to be re-run to obtain the concentrations in the dilution series and confirm that the parameters are valid for the input file.</p>


<h2>Loading Input</h2>
<p>Input files must be in Stepone or Fluidigm format. Spreadsheet and custom format are typically output from excel-type programs. At present only Fluidigm and Spreadsheet are functional.</p>
<p>If you try to load a file in a format different from the format specified in the Input Format field, the program will likely crash. So do not do this.</p>

<h2>Checking Input/Parameters</h2>
<p>The LOD (Limit of Detection) is used to flag input values above a threshold. This parameter can seriously effect the number of A+ GOIs so ridiculous values should be avoided.</p>
<p>In order to run ValidPrime, certian row and column labels must be selected to dictate where the 
gDNA Sample columns are and where the ValidPrime Assay is in the input. This is why input must be loaded 
prior to the Check step and the Check step needs to be run twice for a new input file. Loading the input gives ValidPrime the row and column labels to enable their selection in the 'Input Parameters' section.</p>
<p>Once Check has been run and the gDNA Samples are properly input, if the gDNA concentrations are not in the row lables, you can enter them manually using the Check/Set [gDNA] button.</p>
<p>If there are Rows (Samples) or Columns (Assays) you want ValidPrime to ingore, set them as well.</p>
<p>When using a gDNA dilution series, the Delta-Cq refers to the difference between the CqNA for each dilution point between the VPA and the GOI. If there are more than Min-Count points, the Standard Deviation (SD) will be calculated and GOIs above the SD-Cutoff will be flagged as HIGHSD.</p>
<p>If Check was successful, the Run button will become enabled and you can run ValidPrime.</p>

<h2>Run ValidPrime</h2>
<p>ValidPrime assigns Grades based on the %-DNA in each cell of the input grid. The defaults are 3% or less for an A, 25% or less for a B, and 50% or less for a C. Any cell in which the %-DNA is greater than or equal to the Grade C max will be flagged as HIGHDNA.</p>

<h2>Viewing and Saving Results</h2>
<p>Use the Generate Output Names button to create a series of output file names based on the input file. 
Select any output files you want to create via the individual checkboxes. Upon clicking 'Save' each selected output file will be created.</p>
<p>In order to merely view the results within ValidPrime, you can use the View menu to select the results 
to view in a simple grid.The Toggle Grid button can be used to show different types of values in the main application grid as well.</p>
<p>The ValidPrime scores can also be viewed in a HeatMap (experimental).</p>
